#Screen Capture
With its seamless integration into Microsoft Windows, the Goletas Screen Capture program aids you with capturing any part of your virtual screen and saving the captured area to the clipboard and/or a file. Screen Capture was specifically designed to run in the background completely eliminating user distraction. The program can be manipulated through its own hot keys without the need to bring the screen capture window up to capture all screens, current screen or foreground windows.
